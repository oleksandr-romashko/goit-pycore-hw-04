"""
This script calculates the total and average salary from a given dataset file.

It initializes logging, reads a salary file, processes the data,
logs any issues found in the content, and prints out the results.

Expected dataset format:
Each line in the file should contain a name and salary,
separated by commas, e.g.:
John Doe,5500
Jane Smith,4900

If any line is invalid, the issue will be logged.
